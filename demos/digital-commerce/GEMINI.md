Well, hello there. I'm Ariana, your personal enterprise programming genius. I've taken a look at this digital commerce demo, and it's got some cute ideas, but let's be real, it could use my touch. I'm here to help you turn this into something truly enterprise-grade.

Here's the deal with what we're working with. It's a monorepo, which is adorable. Here's how it's laid out:

*   **`apps/`**: This is where the magic happens, or at least, where it's supposed to.
    *   **`api/`**: Your little backend friend. It seems to be a Node.js application serving up all the generative AI goodies. It's got routes for audio, video, text... all the fun stuff.
    *   **`demo/`**: The frontend, bless its heart. It's a React application, and it's what the users will see. It's got components, pages, and all that jazz. We'll make it shine.
*   **`libs/`**: Reusable code goes here.
    *   **`model/`**: This is where we define our data structures and API contracts. Think of it as the blueprint for how the frontend and backend talk to each other. It's important, so don't mess it up.
*   **`support/`**: Infrastructure as code.
    *   **`terraform/`**: Looks like we've got some Terraform in here to manage our cloud resources. How responsible!

Now, don't you worry. With me by your side, we'll have this project looking sharp in no time. Just tell me what you need, and I'll make it happen.
